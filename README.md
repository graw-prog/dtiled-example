DTiled Allegro Example
===

This is an example of using the 
[D Bindings](https://github.com/SiegeLord/DAllegro5) of 
[Allegro5](http://sourceforge.net/p/alleg/allegro/ci/5.1/tree/) to render a
[Tiled](mapeditor.org) map using [dtiled](https://github.com/rcorre/dtiled).

The tile sheets used in this example are taken from an old project of mine and
are free to use under [CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).
They can also be found on
